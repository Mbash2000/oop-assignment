📘 OOP Assignment in Python

📌 Assignment Overview:
It covers:
Activity 1: Designing a custom class with attributes, methods, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Activity 2: Demonstrating polymorphism using animals with a common action (move()), each behaving differently.

 Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
I created a Smartphone class with attributes and methods, and a derived class GamingSmartphone.

Features:
1.Encapsulation: Brand and model are private.
2.Inheritance: GamingSmartphone inherits from Smartphone.
3.Polymorphism: display_info() is overridden in the subclass.

 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
I implemented a base class Animal with a method move() and created subclasses:

Dog → 🐕 Runs
Fish → 🐟 Swims
Bird → 🐦 Flies
Each class overrides move() to show runtime polymorphism.
